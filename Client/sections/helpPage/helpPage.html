                                        A linear actuator creates motion in a straight line, in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor.
                                        Linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery, in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers,
                                        in valves and dampers, and in many other places where linear motion is required. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce
                                        linear motion. Many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor.

                                        Workpiece carrier (WT) is a part of a transfer system to guide products along an optimal path through the assembly line.
                                        These components rest on the two belts of the conveyor, which propels them forward. Guide rails mounted on the side of the belt profile
                                        direct the workpiece carriers.

                                        A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many
                                        types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of
                                        carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the
                                        belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main
                                        industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material
                                        handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand,
                                        overburden and more.

                                        Contanimation is a change in the physical characteristics of the carriers which can be as a result of external factors such as dust or human
                                        intervention or internal factors such as friction. Contanimation of a carrier would result in the change in energy consumption for that specific
