                        data to different carriers. Once a carrier has passed through the production line, its data is compressed for
                        size reduction and is exported as cvs file. Details on the data compression can be found in "2. Compress Data".

                In reality this script should run the whole time. But to save ressources in this project, a simple termination option was implemented.
                On Startup compressInitialData.py creates Running.txt and deletes it after the data simulation is terminated. This enables to terminate
                writeCarrierDataToDataBase.py. As soon as compressInitialData.py is terminated, Running.txt is deleted and as soon as writeCarrierDataToDataBase.py
                doesn't find Running.txt anymore it terminates.
