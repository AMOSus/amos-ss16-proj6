            <td class="text-left">
                A linear actuator creates motion in a straight line, in contrast to the circular motion of a conventional electric motor.
                Linear actuators are used in machine tools and industrial machinery, in computer peripherals such as disk drives and printers,
                in valves and dampers, and in many other places where linear motion is required. Hydraulic or pneumatic cylinders inherently produce
                linear motion. Many other mechanisms are used to generate linear motion from a rotating motor.

                Workpiece carrier (WT) is a part of a transfer system to guide products along an optimal path through the assembly line.
                These components rest on the two belts of the conveyor, which propels them forward. Guide rails mounted on the side of the belt profile
                direct the workpiece carriers.

            <td class="text-left">
                A conveyor belt is the carrying medium of a belt conveyor system (often shortened to belt conveyor). A belt conveyor system is one of many
                types of conveyor systems. A belt conveyor system consists of two or more pulleys (sometimes referred to as drums), with an endless loop of
                carrying medium—the conveyor belt—that rotates about them. One or both of the pulleys are powered, moving the belt and the material on the
                belt forward. The powered pulley is called the drive pulley while the unpowered pulley is called the idler pulley. There are two main
                industrial classes of belt conveyors; Those in general material handling such as those moving boxes along inside a factory and bulk material
                handling such as those used to transport large volumes of resources and agricultural materials, such as grain, salt, coal, ore, sand,
                overburden and more.

                The Flexibility Measure is the average of the deviation of Carrier speeds from the mean Carrier speeds over all timestamps where more than one carrier is on the Conveyor Belt.
                In other words: For every time stamp when at least two Carriers are moving at the same time on the Conveyor Belt, their speed deviation is calculated.
                The Flexibility Measure averages this measure over all Time Stamps.
                This results in a lower measure, when the carriers are moving equally fast for a longer time, a higher measure, when the carriers are moving at more different speeds more often, and in the measure being zero when only one carrier is selected.
                The dimension of the measure is the same as the speed of the Carriers. For better visualization the measure is later multiplied by 100 and rounded after the first two digits.
