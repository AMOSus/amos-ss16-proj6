                        <strong>1.</strong> In order to detect Energy Spikes we decided to implement a table that ranks energy peaks.
                        The user goes to the Circles View and choses the button on the bottom right to change to the Energy Spikes Contamination.

                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>2.</strong> The logic behind the table: for every timestamp the energy consumption of the carrier at this point of
                        time is compared as a % to the average energy consumption of that carrier for the current iteration. The table then collects
                        all these values and ranks them in descending order. It shows the corresponding Carrier, Iteration, %. There is a possibility
                        to look up the spike in detail by clicking on the “play” button on the right. In the following example Carrier 5 in Iteration
                        1 has the highest spike.

                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>3.</strong>The Investigate button redirects the user to a graph (Continuous Consumption Graph) that shows the
                        Energy Consumption for every timestamp of the selected carrier and iteration. There is a visible spike before the end.
                        In order to represent data correctly, we disregard the energy drops right after the carrier enters the flexible line and the
                        spike right before exiting the flexible line.
