                        <strong>1.</strong> In order to Import data the user goes to the Simulation Page by choosing the “play”
                        button on the navigation bar on the left side of the page.

                        <strong>2.</strong> The user then selects a pre-loaded csv file with demonstrator data (currently the four files
                        we received are loaded as per default) and clicks on start simulation. The simulated csv files will appear on the
                        right side of the page in the form of a table. There is also a possibility to import data (Upload New CSV-file).
                        The file needs to be in the exact same format as the provided files.
