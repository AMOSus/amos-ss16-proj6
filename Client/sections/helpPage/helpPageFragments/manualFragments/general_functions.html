                First of all, the application provides two views of the current
                condition of carriers: Circles View and Bar Chart View

                        Selecting the Circle View shows a list of carriers and the current state of their energy consumption.
                        Circle View has two different sub-views that offer data based on what type of contamination the user
                        expects to detect.
                    </p>
                    <ul class="list-group">

                            <strong>1.</strong> Creeping Contamination – energy consumption
                            for the carrier is calculated as the average energy consumption
                            (current iteration) of the carrier to the average energy consumption
                            of that carrier from the 1st 10% of the iterations

                        </li>

                            <strong>2.</strong> Continuous Contamination – energy consumption for the
                            carrier is calculated as the average energy consumption of the current carrier
                            over average energy consumption of all the carriers for all iterations
                        </li>

                    <p>
                        Green circles depict no or minimal increase in energy consumption, yellow – slight increase
                        and red – a significant increase.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In order to switch between the two views there is a toggle button under the circles.
