                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>1.</strong> In order to detect Creeping Contamination the user clicks on the Circles View which provides a hint
                        regarding where the energy consumption has been increasing. The user should select the “problematic”
                        carriers depicted in yellow and red. In this case carriers 1, 6, 7 and 8.

                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>2.</strong> After selecting the circles the user should click on one of the Graph Views in order to analyze the situation.
                        The best way for this scenario is to chose the Average Consumption Graph

                    <img src="assets/images/manual images/Bild8.png"  class="img-responsive">
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>3.</strong> The User then gets a chart displayed with Energy Consumption over All Iterations for the selected carriers.
                        This page offers the options to chose carriers, iterations, dimensions, trace (imported csv.) and a button to switch to other graphs.
                        Switching to Continuous Consumption offers the possibility to look up Energy Consumption, Position, Acceleration and Speed for every carrier per
                        Iteration in more detail. In order to detect creeping contamination we suggest examining Average Energy Consumption and Total Energy Consumption
                        from the Dimensions selection.
                    </p>
                    <strong>Total Energy Consumption for the selected carriers, all iterations, Trace - SV</strong>
                    <img src="assets/images/manual images/Bild9.png"  class="img-responsive">
                    </br>
                    <strong>Average Energy Consumption for the selected carriers, all iterations, Trace - SV</strong>
                    <img src="assets/images/manual images/Bild10.png"  class="img-responsive">
                </li>
                <li class="list-group-item text-left">
                    <p>
                        <strong>4.</strong> Detecting the Contamination: In both graphs a steady rise in energy consumption is clearly visible.
                        This lets the user conclude that there is a creeping contamination. The trace used for this analysis was Trace_SV. The test setup:
                        dirt was poured on the carriers in order to increase their energy consumption. We also provide a comparison between Total and
                        Average Energy Consumption between this scenario (SV) and the normal case scenario (NB) that clearly shows the difference.
