<!-- Manual, to be inserted into the help page -->

    <h1>Manual</h1>
    <p>
        This short manual will provide an overview on how the basic
        functionalities of the Demonstrator Data Analytics App work
    </p>
    <p>
        The application loads a csv file with data generated from the
        demonstrator and provides visualization of carriers data in order to
        detect different types of contamination
    </p>
    <p>
        This guide will show how an operator should look for different
        types of contamination
    </p>
