                        <strong>1.</strong> In order to detect Continuous Contamination the user should load the Trace_DV file
                        and click on the Circles View and choose the button Change View to Continuous Contamination.

                        <strong>2.</strong> The application shows the possibility of a Continuous contamination in Carriers
                        1, 2, 3, 13 and 14. We recommend to compare these again in the Average Consumption Graph by choosing Total Energy Consumption.

                    <p>
                        <strong>3.</strong> A comparison of the Total Energy Consumption of these carriers over the course of every iteration reveals that
                        these carriers  consume a high energy in the beginning.  In the test setup of Trace_DV toothpaste was put on some of the carriers.
                        This could explain the high consumption in the beginning that wears of after time as movement removes the toothpaste. In this trace the “red”
                        (contaminated) carriers start with a very high initial total consumption of about 150% of initial energy consumption in other traces.

                        <strong>4.</strong> For a better analysis, we recommend to compare Carrier 1 with Carriers 4,5 (or any other) which the application
                        does not indicate as contaminated. A comparison of the Total Energy further confirms the assertion that Carrier 1 (as shown earlier)
                        had continuous contamination throughout.
