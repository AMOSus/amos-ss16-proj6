<!-- This page displays the circle carrier dashbaord view fragment. The function circleGraph will be called to create circles,
     depending on the amount of carriers avaiable in the database.
     Also, the comparison sidebar is shown in this snippet. When the user puts carriers into the comparison sidebar, the sidebar will open
     and show all items stored. The User can remove the items by clicking on the "remove " button next to the item.
